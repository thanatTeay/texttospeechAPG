Seasons change
mad things rearrange
But it all stays
the same
like the love doctor Strange
I'm tame like the rapper
Get red like a snapper
when they do that
Got your whole block saying True dat
If only they knew that
it was you who was irregular
Sold your soul for some secular muzak that's wack
Plus you use that
loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style 
Your attempts are futile
ooh child
You puerile
brain waves are sterile
You can't create you just wait to take my tapes
